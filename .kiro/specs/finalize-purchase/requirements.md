# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the "finalizar compra" (finalize purchase) functionality for the JJ Cal√ßados shopping cart system. The system will process cart items and create sales records in city-specific MySQL tables (vendas_tabira or vendas_princesa) based on the logged-in user's city. The feature handles payment method distribution, product pricing with discounts, and maintains proper relationships between users, products, and sales data.

4. IF the user's cidade field is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent purchase completion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want sales records to maintain proper relationships and timestamps, so that I can track who made the sale and when it occurred.

### Requirement 4

4. IF any error occurs during sales record creation THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and maintain the cart contents

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the purchase process to handle errors gracefully, so that partial sales are not created and data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple cart items THEN the system SHALL use database transactions to ensure all-or-nothing processing
